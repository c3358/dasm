|DASM|
------
A disassembler for x86 windows binaries. Coded completely from scratch with a small part of it from Matt Pietrek's PEDUMP.exe (see http://www.wheaty.net/downloads.htm). It supports all integer, floating-point, MMX and SSE1 instructions. The new AES instruction set is also supported. Support for SSE2 and newer instruction will be added in future.

Please feel free to reuse code from this project. Kindly include a reference to me in your code. :)
